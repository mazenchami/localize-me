# Localize Me ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the repo for Localize Me, a mobile app that helps you learn new languages by translating your favorite songs. This project was created for my [2024 React Universe Conf](https://www.reactuniverseconf.com/) talk called `Lost in Translation? Turning Babel into Brilliance` hosted by [Callstack](https://www.callstack.com/).

Apps arenâ€™t always confined to one country or language. And if youâ€™re already doing all the work of building out a whole app, why not expand your user base to the millions of non-English speakers? In this session Iâ€™ll show how internationalization (i18n) is more than just replacing translation strings, making your app accessible to a global audience, including the often-overlooked 750 million speakers of right-to-left (RTL) languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Urdu. Iâ€™ll show you practical steps, compare the different i18n libraries, and talk about success stories â€” such as when my mom helped me translate our Ignite boilerplate project to Arabic. Youâ€™ll walk away with confidence and tools to expand your user base and stand out.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
    yarn
   ```

2. Run Expo Prebuild

   ```bash
    yarn prebuild
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    yarn start
   ```

4. Run the app

   ```bash
    yarn {ios/android}
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
yarn run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
